## Module Description

This module is crafted to solidify the understanding of core JavaScript concepts. By reinforcing the knowledge of the language's 
building blocks, you will be equipped with the skills necessary to tackle more complex programming challenges and frameworks.

Strengthen JavaScript knowledge:

- Numbers methods
- Strings methods
- Functions
- Context, Scope and Closures

Front-end developers work extensively with **JavaScript** and other scripting languages, which are fundamental for 
creating interactive websites. Numbers, strings, and functions are core concepts in these languages, and here's
why they are crucial for a front-end developer:

1. **Numbers and Strings**: These are basic data types in almost all programming languages. They are used to represent
and manipulate data in a program.

 * **Numbers**: They are used for calculations, and also for logic and comparison operations. Also, it is frequently 
used when setting styles for elements using JavaScript, such as widths, heights, or time durations for animations 
and transitions.

 * **Strings**: They are used to represent and manipulate text. Front-end developers use strings to work with text data, 
create dynamic content, change and update text in the DOM, handle user input, and more.

2. **Functions**: Functions allow code to be called multiple times with different arguments. It helps in keeping your 
program to follow DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself), making the code easier to read, debug, and maintain.

 * **Functions** are essential for structuring the code into reusable blocks.

 * They are especially important in **JavaScript**, as they are the main way to control scope and build private and public APIs.

 * **Functions** are also used extensively in DOM manipulation and event handling, serving as callback functions that are 
executed when an event occurs.

 * Many built-in methods and third-party libraries also utilize functions.

3. **Context, Scope and Closures**: A critical piece of understanding any programming language is understanding the availability of 
variables and functions, how state is maintained, and how to access that state.

In conclusion, numbers, strings, and functions are foundational concepts that are extensively used when interacting 
with the DOM, handling events, manipulating data, or even making API calls. A good understanding of these is absolutely 
necessary for a front-end developer. Understanding 'this' context, closures, and function timing with setTimeout and setInterval will 
equip you with essential skills for advanced JavaScript programming.
